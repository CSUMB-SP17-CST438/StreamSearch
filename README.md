STREAM SEARCH(previously named OverLook)

Description: Let us do the searching

Stream Search gives you the ability to search for Movies and TV shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO GO all-in-one place. When you find the movie or TV show you like simply click on the link; and it will tell you a summary about the movie/show, when it was released, time duration of movie/show, and a movie trailer linked from YouTube. For TV shows you can view the available seasons, a summary plot of the episodes, and a link to the Streaming services where that Show or Movie is available to watch.
