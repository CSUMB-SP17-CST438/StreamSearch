STREAM SEARCH(previously named OverLook)

Description: Let us do the searching

Stream Search gives someone the ability to search for Movies and TV shows. When you find the movie you like simply click on the link; and it will tell you a summary about the movie/show, when it was released, time duration of movie/show, and a movie trailer linked from YouTube.

List of changes made in Handin 2, 4/10:
